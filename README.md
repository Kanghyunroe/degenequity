L/S Degen Equity (all non ESG factors, think MIC, Tobacco, Oil,)

**Thoughts**
Backup plan in case i get bored with wheat futures 
I want to trade an anti ESG portfolio systematically -- seems fun but it needs to be careful with how wallstreet moves 

**Considerations**
1) how will I choose which sectors/stocks to invest in
2) how to avoid massive market movements + black swan events (oil spills and stuff)
3) make the bot learn on its own yk - become more degenerate

**Steps**
1) stock picker (what factors to look at yk)
2) develop own metrics for ESG stocks - incorporate how I think
3) analyze for any future black swan events??? IDK HOW THIS WILL WORK
4) If 3 not work, risk management (hedging etc.)
5) Learning component, how to become more degen
6) Connection to paper portfolio and backtest
7) Make risk management extra thick
